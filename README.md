Exsercise2: A typescript code for ersonal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”

Here's a TypeScript script that accomplishes the task you described:

```typescript
let personName: string = "Eric";
let message: string = `Hello ${personName}, would you like to learn some Python today?`;
console.log(message);
```

Let's break down the code:

1. We declare a variable called `personName` and assign the value `"Eric"` to it. This variable will store the person's name.
2. We declare a variable called `message` and use a template literal (denoted by backticks `` ` ``) to create a string. Inside the template literal, we include the `personName` variable using the `${}` syntax to interpolate its value into the string.
3. The `message` variable is assigned the value `"Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?"`.
4. Finally, we use `console.log()` to print the message to the console.

When you run this script, it will output the following message to the console:

```
Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?
```

Feel free to modify the `personName` variable to include a different name if you want to personalize the message for someone else.
